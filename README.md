Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.
Customer Churn dataset is give table named:
Customer churn dataset which has 23 columns and 7043 rows of observation
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:
Replaced the value is SeniorCitizen N coverted No and Y converted Yes
In the new table, one additional conditional columns were added using M-formula:
loyalty = SWITCH(TRUE(),'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=12,"< 1 year",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=24,"< 2 years",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=36,"< 3 years",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=48,"< 4 years", '01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=60,"< 5 years",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=72,"< 6 years")
Removed Unnecessary columns
Removed Unnecessary rows
Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type
